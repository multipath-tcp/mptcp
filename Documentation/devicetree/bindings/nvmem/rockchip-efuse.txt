= Rockchip eFuse device tree bindings =

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "rockchip,rockchip-efuse"
- reg: Should contain the registers location and exact eFuse size
- clocks: Should be the clock id of eFuse
- clock-names: Should be "pclk_efuse"

= Data cells =
Are child nodes of eFuse, bindings of which as described in
bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

	efuse: efuse@ffb40000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rockchip-efuse";
		reg = <0xffb40000 0x20>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&cru PCLK_EFUSE256>;
		clock-names = "pclk_efuse";

		/* Data cells */
		cpu_leakage: cpu_leakage {
			reg = <0x17 0x1>;
		};
	};

= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

Example:

	cpu_leakage {
		...
		nvmem-cells = <&cpu_leakage>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "cpu_leakage";
	};
