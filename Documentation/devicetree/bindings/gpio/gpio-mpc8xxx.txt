* Freescale MPC512x/MPC8xxx/Layerscape GPIO controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "fsl,<soc>-gpio"
  The following <soc>s are known to be supported:
    mpc5121, mpc5125, mpc8349, mpc8572, mpc8610, pq3, qoriq.
- reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts : Should be the port interrupt shared by all 32 pins.
- #gpio-cells : Should be two.  The first cell is the pin number and
  the second cell is used to specify the gpio polarity:
      0 = active high
      1 = active low

Optional properties:
- little-endian : GPIO registers are used as little endian. If not
                  present registers are used as big endian by default.

Example:

gpio0: gpio@1100 {
	compatible = "fsl,mpc5125-gpio";
	#gpio-cells = <2>;
	reg = <0x1100 0x080>;
	interrupts = <78 0x8>;
	status = "okay";
};
