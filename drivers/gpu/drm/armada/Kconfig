	  Support the "LCD" controllers found on the Marvell Armada 510
	  devices.  There are two controllers on the device, each controller
	  supports graphics and video overlays.

	  This driver provides no built-in acceleration; acceleration is
	  performed by other IP found on the SoC.  This driver provides
	  kernel mode setting and buffer management to userspace.
