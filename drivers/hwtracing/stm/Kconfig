	select CONFIGFS_FS
	help
	  A System Trace Module (STM) is a device exporting data in System
	  Trace Protocol (STP) format as defined by MIPI STP standards.
	  Examples of such devices are Intel(R) Trace Hub and Coresight STM.

	  Say Y here to enable System Trace Module device support.

config STM_DUMMY
	tristate "Dummy STM driver"
	help
	  This is a simple dummy device that pretends to be an stm device
	  and discards your data. Use for stm class testing.

	  If you don't know what this is, say N.

config STM_SOURCE_CONSOLE
	tristate "Kernel console over STM devices"
	help
	  This is a kernel space trace source that sends kernel log
	  messages to trace hosts over STM devices.

	  If you want to send kernel console messages over STM devices,
	  say Y.
