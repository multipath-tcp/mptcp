config IIO_BUFFER_CB
	tristate "IIO callback buffer used for push in-kernel interfaces"
	help
	  Should be selected by any drivers that do in-kernel push
	  usage.  That is, those where the data is pushed to the consumer.

config IIO_KFIFO_BUF
	tristate "Industrial I/O buffering based on kfifo"
	help
	  A simple fifo based on kfifo.  Note that this currently provides
	  no buffer events so it is up to userspace to work out how
	  often to read from the buffer.

config IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	tristate
	select IIO_TRIGGER
	select IIO_KFIFO_BUF
	help
	  Provides helper functions for setting up triggered buffers.
